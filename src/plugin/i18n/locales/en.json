For example, when a color's name (e.g. blue, green, red, orange) is displayed in a color that does not correspond to its name (e.g. the word 'red' displayed in green ink instead of red ink, or the word 'orange' displayed in blue ink instead of orange ink), it takes longer for the person to identify the color of the ink compared to when the word and the ink color match, and the identification process is also more prone to errors. The Stroop effect is also used to create a famous psychological experiment known as the 'Stroop test'.",
